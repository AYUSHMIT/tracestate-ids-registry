# Distributed Tracing Working Group

This repository is being used for work in the [W3C Distributed Trace Context
Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/).

See [Registration Entry Requirements and Update
Process](https://w3c.github.io/trace-state-ids-registry/#Registration_Entry_Requirements_and_Update_Process)
section of this specification for the protocol registration requirements.

## Trying it out locally

This repository is using [ReSpec](https://w3c.github.io/respec/) to generate
the report. To see report locally, you can use any web server pointed to the
root of this directory.

With `python` you can use one of the following commands to see report at
[localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

``` sh
# with python 3
python -m http.server

# with python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```


## Editing report

This repository follows the best practices from https://w3c.github.io/

- Report is generated by [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki).
- We highly encourage to use line breaks in markdown files at 80 characters
  wide. There are tools that can do it for you effectively. Please submit
  proposal to include your editor settings required to enable this behavior so
  the out of the box settings for this repository will be consistent.
- To view report locally - start the local server like `python -m
  SimpleHTTPServer` to avoid cross-site file loading issue
- You can preview report from your branch or fork
  `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/<organization>/trace-state-ids-registry/blob/<branchname>/index.html`.
  It is useful to review PR suggestions.

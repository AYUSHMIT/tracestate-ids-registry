## Purpose

Trace context [[TRACE-CONTEXT]] consists of properties crucial for event
correlation, used to monitor the health and reliability of a distributed
application. The [[TRACE-CONTEXT]] specification defines the
`tracestate` <a
data-cite="TRACE-CONTEXT#trace-context-http-headers-format">header</a>.

This registry is intended to provide a central location for enumerating
identifiers user by `tracestate`.
